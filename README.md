# odin-landing-page
1. I did not commit often enough to check the types of changes I made compared to the inital commit. Need to work on that.

2. I added a media query to remove hero image as soon as viewport width is 1162px (which makes the page somewhat responsive), but I would like this hardcoded value to be variable according to the user's viewport, not just mine. I could not find a solution.

3. I made the header "sticky", which looks nicer IMO

4. Would love for someone to dissect the html and css to advise me how to make it a bit more compact?
    a. class naming. I've got so many individual classes in my html, that declaring them all in css becomes tedious.
    b. Do I have too many flex containers? I've got a feeling the structure is probably a bit too convoluted, where perhaps regular <div> boxes may be sufficient.
